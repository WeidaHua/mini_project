# mini_project
1. I hope you download all the repository into VScode cause I put all the necessary files in it.
2. mini_project.py is the main project, just run it.
3. model_visualizaion.pdf is the whole Resnet model structure image which is partly shown in report.
In mini_project.py, about trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./', train=True, download=False, transform=transform_train), just as I have already put the cifar-10 dataset into this repository. If you just download only one mini_project.py, you need change the code into root='./data' and download=True. Testset is the same.
